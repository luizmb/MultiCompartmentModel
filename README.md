# MultiCompartmentModel

This code is a direct translation from a C# code, which was a direct translation from a Pascal code written decades ago, so please don't expect it to look Swift-ish yet, maybe at some point in the future when (if) I fully understand the math behind it.

The goal here is to use multi-compartment models to calculate dosimetry.
