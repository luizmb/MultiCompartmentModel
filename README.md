# MultiCompartmentModel

This code is a direct translation from a C# code (https://github.com/tclaro/ipen), which was a direct translation from a Pascal code written decades ago, so please don't expect it to look Swift-ish yet, maybe at some point in the future when (if) I fully understand the math behind it.

The goal here is to use numerical method for solving first-order differential equation, when using multi-compartment models to calculate radiation dosimetry.

For more details please check this paper written by my professor and friend Thiago Claro:
